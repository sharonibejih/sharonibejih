### Hiya! ðŸ‘‹

I am Sharon Ibejih and I'm happy you've found yourself here.

I am into AI and have done pretty much with [Research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6sZXvpAAAAAJ&hl=en). I am expanding my knowledge in software engineering and machine learning operations. 

Some of my repositories contain a documentation of my learning and some notes, while others are interesting projects I have worked on.

You can reach me via email: sharonibejih@gmail.com
